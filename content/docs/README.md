# About Particle Workshops

---

Particle workshops are half- and full-day hands on explorations of the Particle ecosystem, including hardware, firmware, and software. Each workshop is led by Particle employees or community advocates, and are designed to give developers new to IoT development the hands-on training they need to confidently build their own IoT solutions, at home, work, and beyond!

The workshops are broken into presentations intermixed with hands-on labs that reinforce presentation content.

## Before you start

1.  Create a new [Particle account](https://login.particle.io/signup).
2.  Install the Particle [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/particle-build-photon-electron/id991459054?ls=1&mt=8) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.particle.android.app) App.
3.  [Install the Particle CLI](https://docs.particle.io/tutorials/developer-tools/cli/).
4.  [Install the Particle Workbench IDE](https://www.particle.io/workbench#installation).

## Workshop Content

- Lab 1: Claiming your Particle Device
  - Unbox a brand new Argon, claim it to your Particle account, and make it light up with Tinker.
- Lab 2: Particle Workbench & Primitives
  - Read from and program the sensors included with your IoT Starter Kit, use particle primities to expose sensor data to the cloud, trigger actions and fire events.
- Lab 3: Exploring BLE & Advanced Device OS Features
  - Learn how to use BLE with Particle devices, as well as advanced Device OS features like threading, sleep mode, and more.
- Lab 4: Exploring Particle SDKs & Integrations
  - Explore Particle SDKs for building Web apps, and build an integration
  to connect your Particle device to the ThingSpeak platform.
